2) Unzip it, place it in a folder wherever you want. There should be a folder called "Ishiiruka-FM-v5.66-BETA" that contains the Dolphin build.

Make sure this folder and your Brawl .iso is where you want it BEFORE setting this up. Don't move netplay related folders around after setup or you're gonna be sad.

3) Go to Ishiiruka-FM-v5.66-BETA\User\Wii. Copy + paste the "sd hannemann pyotr".raw file (from the pmstuff folder) into there.

4) Rename "sd hannemann pyotr".raw to "sd".raw . If you don't have file extensions enabled, it should just be called "sd".

Make sure you don't accidentally name it "sd.raw".raw

5) Go back a couple folders and open Dolphin.exe.

6) Click on Config.

7) In General, make sure the Speed Limit is set to 100%.

8) Click on the Wii tab. Make sure that "Insert SD Card" is checked.

9) Click on the Paths tab. Click the "Add..." button, and navigate to the folder where you've stored your Brawl .iso and select it.

10) Now you need to add another path to the PMNetplayV3.elf that came in the pmstuff folder. Personally I created a "Launcher" folder inside the Dolphin build.

As an example, my two Paths look like this:

"D:\Games\Gamecube + Wii ISOs\Brawl ISO" is a folder I created that contains my Brawl .iso.

"D:\Games\Ishiiruka-FM-v5.66-BETA\Launcher" is a folder that I created and tossed the PMNetplayV3.elf file into.

11) Close the Config window.

12) You should now see both Super Smash Bros. Brawl and PMNetplayV3.elf in the list of games you can open. Right click Brawl, and click "Set as default ISO".

13) Click on Graphics. If you're running an Nvidia graphics card, change the Backend to OpenGL instead of Direct3D 11.

14) Make sure the aspect ratio is set to Auto. Close the Graphics window.

15) You're all set. Open PMNetplayV3.elf to start playing.

16) For some reason, music runs at double speed. Every time you boot the game, turn off the music in options, gameplay is normal (with less input lag).

17) If for some reason, the Launcher screen says Gecko instead of Smashladder Project M Netplay V3, there's a few common issues:

1. You didn't check Insert SD Card in Config -> Wii.

2. The .raw file in Ishiiruka-FM-v5.66-BETA\User\Wii is not named "sd".

3. Brawl is not set as the default .iso.
